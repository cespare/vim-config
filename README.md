# Vim configuration

This folder has my default vim configuration. I don't have any kind of writeup
where I explain it, and I change it all the time, but the internet abounds with
good vim resources. A few that I would recommend are the following:

* [Vim: So long Pathogen, hello native package loading](https://shapeshed.com/vim-packages/)
  describes how to use Vim 8 packages.
* [Coming Home to Vim](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/)
  is a fantastic post on vim plugins, configuration, etc.
* [How I Boosted my Vim](http://nvie.com/posts/how-i-boosted-my-vim/)
  is a decent intro to vim configuration.
